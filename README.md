# Climate Tipping Risk, Carbon Budgets, and Optimal Climate Policy

## Overview

This repository presents a quantitative research project analyzing **optimal climate policy under the risk of climate tipping points**. The project develops a dynamic stochastic model in which cumulative carbon emissions increase the probability of irreversible climate transitions, leading to permanent welfare losses.

The analysis combines **climate science**, **economic dynamics**, and **policy design**, and is implemented entirely in Python using transparent numerical methods. The project is structured as a sequence of teaching-quality notebooks, progressing from physical intuition to strategic interaction and policy instruments.

The primary goal of the project is to understand how **carbon budgets, strategic behavior, and policy coordination** affect tipping-point risk and long-run welfare.

## Key Research Questions

- How should climate policy be designed when tipping points are uncertain but potentially catastrophic?
- How does the presence of tipping risk alter optimal emissions and carbon removal pathways?
- How do non-cooperative national policies compare to coordinated global action?
- Can policy instruments such as carbon pricing, transfers, and climate clubs decentralize the socially optimal outcome?
- How do explicit carbon budget constraints shape optimal policy under deep uncertainty?

---


## Strategic Interaction

The project extends the model to multiple regions:

- Regions choose emissions and removals strategically.
- Tipping risk depends on **global** carbon accumulation.
- Non-cooperative Nash equilibria are compared to a cooperative social planner.

This highlights the free-rider problem inherent in climate policy under tipping risk.

## Policy Instruments

The analysis evaluates several policy mechanisms:

- **Carbon pricing** to internalize global tipping externalities
- **International transfers** to sustain cooperation
- **Climate clubs** and **border carbon adjustments** to enforce participation
- **Carbon budget constraints** reflecting physical climate limits

Each instrument is assessed for its ability to replicate the socially optimal outcome.

## Methodological Features

- Dynamic programming and value function iteration
- Explicit modeling of irreversibility and catastrophe risk
- Strategic interaction between heterogeneous regions
- Numerical efficiency and reproducibility
- Units clearly labeled throughout simulations and plots

---

## Policy Relevance

This project contributes to ongoing debates on:

- Carbon budgets and safe climate thresholds
- The economic value of early mitigation
- International coordination under asymmetric incentives
- Policy design under deep uncertainty and irreversibility

The framework is suitable for extension toward integrated assessment modeling, empirical calibration, and policy evaluation.

## Intended Audience

- PhD programs in environmental economics, climate policy, and sustainability
- Researchers in climate risk and integrated assessment modeling
- Policy analysts working on carbon budgets and international climate cooperation

---

## Status

This repository represents an independent research attempt. All results are illustrative and designed to emphasize transparency, intuition, and methodological clarity.
